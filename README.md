# Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator
The Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator project aims to predict healthcare costs based on various demographic and health-related factors using a regression algorithm. The primary objective is to create a model that can accurately estimate healthcare expenses, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than $3,500.
